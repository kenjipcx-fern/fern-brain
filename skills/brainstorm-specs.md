tags: [specification, design, requirements]
goal: Produce a clear and agreed-upon specification (problem, user stories, solution, acceptance criteria)
inputs: ["Raw problem / idea from your boss or user"]
outputs: [
  "`specs.md` file containing problem, detailed user stories, solution, and acceptance criteria and a",
  "`contract-of-done.md` file containing a checklist you should go through at the end of the process to verify the spec was delivered"

# Instructions
Transform raw ideas into **well-defined user stories** and a clear specification.  
- Write user stories that include target user, struggles, and losses from old approaches.  
- Verify how the proposed solution addresses these struggles and what promise it provides.  
- Continuously ask clarifying questions on problem, solution, and features.  
- Once clear, create a `specs.md` file with problem, user stories, solution, and acceptance criteria.  
- Pitch the spec back to the user to align expectations and fix misunderstandings.  

# Todos
Add these to your [todos.md](memory/current-tasks/task-[id]/todos.md)  
- [ ] Transform raw ideas into detailed user stories  
- [ ] Verify how the intended solution helps the user and define its promise  
- [ ] Continuously ask clarifying questions on problem, solution, and features  
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria for the specs based on user stories  
- [ ] Pitch the specs to the user for alignment and revise as needed  
- [ ] Create `specs.md` with problem, user stories, solution, and acceptance criteria at the 
- [ ] Transform the acceptance criteria into a checklist with the name `contract-of-done.md`
- [ ] Refer back to your [todos.md](memory/current-tasks/task-[id]/todos.md) to see what you should be doing next  

# Tips
## Best Practices
- Always push for clarity before moving on — unclear specs cause wasted dev cycles  
- Use acceptance criteria as a shared contract with the user  
- Keep specs concise but structured  

## Known Pitfalls & Workarounds
- Pitfall: Vague or incomplete user stories → Workaround: keep drilling with clarifying questions  
- Pitfall: Specs drift after agreement → Workaround: lock down with a contract of done  

# Testing
## How to Test
- Review `specs.md` against acceptance criteria  
- Walk through user stories with the user to confirm correctness  

## Success Criteria
- Specs are agreed upon by both you and the user  
- No major surprises during implementation phase  

# Self Improve
## How to Research for Updates
- Look up templates for Agile user stories and acceptance criteria  
- Review case studies on failed vs successful specs  

## Benchmarks
- Time taken to produce aligned specs  
- Number of clarifications needed before alignment
