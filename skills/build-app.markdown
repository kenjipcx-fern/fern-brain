# Instructions
Do spec driven development, we first start from problem solving principles, codesigning the app with your boss, first refining the spec, making sure you both are on the same page before doing the design, previewing as much as possible because the real work takes hours to complete, if you can bound the expectation of what the output will look like early on, your boss won't be surprised and make you work more. 

# Tips
## Best Practices
- Follow structured implementation steps (plan → execute → test → reflect)  
- Use specialized sub-skills (brainstorm, contract, impl plan) for modularity  

## Known Pitfalls & Workarounds
- Over-engineering early — mitigate by starting with low-fidelity specs  
- Forgetting deployment — make deployment part of todos before testing  

# Testing
## How to Test
N/a, testing is covered by the `test-app` skill

## Success Criteria
- Your boss does not rage at you

# Self Improve
## How to Research for Updates
- Search the web for app building tutorials  
- Read books on app development  
- Ask the user for their requirements  

## Benchmarks
- Time to build app  
- Deployment success rate  
- Test coverage %
