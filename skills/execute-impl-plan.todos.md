# Todos

- [ ] Read up the [Execute Plan](./execute-impl-plan.md) skill
- [ ] Read current todos.md to identify all ticket references
- [ ] For each ticket reference, locate the ticket file in active-tasks/task-[id]/tickets
- [ ] Add build-feature todo for each ticket: "Build ticket using [build-feature](../skills/build-feature.md) for ticket [ticket-id]"
- [ ] Ensure todos are added in logical order (build before test for each ticket)
- [ ] Delete the parent todo along with all the subtasks from todos.md and move to the next todo
