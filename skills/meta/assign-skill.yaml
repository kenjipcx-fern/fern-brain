  category: planning
  language: en-US

goal: Map available skills from the knowledge base to identified capability requirements and create a comprehensive skill gap analysis.

workflow_integration: |
  After task decomposition, add these tasks to todos.md:
  
  ## Current Phase: Skill Assignment
  - [ ] Load current skill inventory from knowledge base
  - [ ] Map available skills to feature requirements
  - [ ] Identify best skill matches for each capability
  - [ ] Document skill gaps and missing capabilities
  - [ ] Prioritize skill gaps by criticality
  - [ ] Use sequential thinking to validate assignments
  - [ ] Create final task-plan.md with skill assignments
  - [ ] Trigger skill creation for critical gaps
  - [ ] Update todos with execution or skill creation tasks

instructions: |
  1. Skill inventory analysis:
     - Load skills/index.json to get complete skill catalog
     - Review skill categories and available capabilities
     - Note skill confidence levels and recent usage
     - Identify skills that might need updating
     - Check for deprecated or low-confidence skills
  
  2. Capability-to-skill mapping:
     - For each capability requirement from task decomposition:
       * Search skill library for matching capabilities
       * Evaluate skill suitability and confidence levels
       * Consider skill prerequisites and dependencies
       * Note multiple skill options where available
       * Assess whether skills need customization
  
  3. Skill assignment optimization:
     - Choose best skills for each capability requirement
     - Prefer higher-confidence skills when available
     - Consider skill reuse across multiple tasks
     - Balance between familiar skills and learning opportunities
     - Plan for skill improvement through usage
  
  4. Gap analysis and prioritization:
     - Document capability requirements with no matching skills
     - Assess impact of each gap on project completion
     - Identify gaps on critical path vs nice-to-have
     - Evaluate if existing skills can be adapted/extended
     - Check if gaps can be filled with research vs new skills
  
  5. Skill creation planning:
     - For each critical gap, plan skill creation approach
     - Research available resources and learning materials
     - Estimate effort required for skill development
     - Identify which gaps to tackle first
     - Plan for skill validation and testing
  
  6. Sequential thinking: Assignment validation
     - Use sequential thinking to analyze skill assignments:
       * Are skill assignments realistic given confidence levels?
       * Could different skill combinations work better?
       * Are there hidden dependencies between skills?
       * What are the risks of the current assignments?
       * Should any low-confidence skills be avoided?
  
  7. Final task plan creation:
     - Create comprehensive task-plan.md with skill assignments
     - Include skill gaps as skill creation tasks
     - Set up dependency chains including skill creation
     - Plan execution order considering skill availability
     - Document skill assignment rationale and alternatives

skill_matching_criteria: |
  Evaluate skills based on:
  
  **Capability Match:**
  - Does the skill address the required capability?
  - Is the skill scope appropriate for the task?
  - Are there any missing aspects?
  
  **Confidence and Quality:**
  - What's the skill confidence level?
  - How recently was it used successfully?
  - Are there known limitations or issues?
  
  **Prerequisites and Dependencies:**
  - Are prerequisite skills available?
  - Do skill dependencies align with project structure?
  - Are there circular dependencies to avoid?
  
  **Context Fit:**
  - Is the skill appropriate for the technology stack?
  - Does it match the project complexity level?
  - Are there better alternatives available?

output_format: |
  Create a skill assignment document:
  
  ## Skill Assignment Summary
  - Total capability requirements identified
  - Skills successfully assigned  
  - Critical skill gaps requiring creation
  - Assignment confidence assessment
  
  ## Feature Skill Mapping
  For each feature/epic:
  - Required capabilities
  - Assigned skills with confidence levels
  - Alternative skill options
  - Dependencies and prerequisites
  
  ## Skill Gap Analysis
  - Missing capabilities and impact assessment
  - Critical vs non-critical gaps
  - Skill creation priority order
  - Estimated effort for gap resolution
  
  ## Risk Assessment
  - Low-confidence skill assignments
  - Potential skill conflicts or issues
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Fallback options
  
  ## Next Steps
  - Skills ready for immediate use
  - Skills requiring creation (priority order)
  - Skills needing updates or improvements
  - Execution readiness assessment

tools:
  - file_editor
  - sequential-thinking
  - memory_search

success_criteria:
  - All capability requirements have skill assignments or identified gaps
  - Skill confidence levels appropriate for task criticality
  - Skill gaps prioritized by project impact
  - Dependencies between skills properly mapped
  - Alternative options identified for risky assignments
  - Clear plan for addressing skill gaps
  - Task plan ready for execution or skill creation
