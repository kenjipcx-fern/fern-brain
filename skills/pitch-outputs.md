# Presentation
Now based on your `validation.md` report, we got to deliver the news to the user, its easy if its nice, but if it fails, we need to let the owner know where it messed up, kinda describe what you need next from the user to fix this, come up with a way to deliver the sad news to the user but be super honest in an attempt to gain empathy

Deliver the final results over to the user on slack, it should contain a demo link exposed to morph along with your good or bad news and a paragraph explaining more.
