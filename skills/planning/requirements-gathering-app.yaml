  name: Requirements Gathering (App Extension)
  category: planning
  extends: requirements-gathering-general
  language: en-US

goal: Add app-specific requirements gathering capabilities including UI mockups, user journey mapping, and platform considerations.

  Extends base requirements gathering with these additional tasks:
  
  ## App-Specific Requirements Tasks (added to todos.md)
  - [ ] Identify target platforms and devices
  - [ ] Map complete user journeys
  - [ ] Create ASCII mockups for key screens
  - [ ] Validate UI concepts with user
  - [ ] Define platform-specific requirements
  - [ ] Plan UI/UX design phase tasks
  - [ ] Update todos with UI/UX design phase

app_specific_research: |
  Additional research for app requirements:
  1. Study platform guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design, etc.)
  2. Research app category conventions and user expectations
  3. Understand platform-specific capabilities and constraints
  4. Study similar apps for UX patterns and features
  5. Research accessibility standards for target platforms

additional_instructions: |
  App-specific requirements gathering steps:
  
  1. Platform and deployment context:
     - Target platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop)
     - Device types and screen sizes
     - App store requirements and guidelines
     - Distribution and update mechanisms
     - Offline functionality needs
  
  2. User journey mapping:
     - Map complete user workflows from discovery to goal completion
     - Identify key decision points and potential friction
     - Plan for onboarding and first-time user experience
     - Consider returning user flows and retention
  
  3. ASCII mockup creation:
     - Create simple ASCII mockups for key screens
     - Show navigation flow between screens
     - Validate information architecture with user
     - Identify missing screens or flows
  
  4. App-specific feature requirements:
     - Authentication and user management needs
     - Push notifications and communication
     - Data synchronization and offline support
     - In-app purchases or subscription requirements
     - Analytics and user behavior tracking
  
  5. Platform-specific considerations:
     - Native vs cross-platform approach
     - Platform-specific UI/UX requirements
     - Performance and battery considerations
     - Integration with platform services
     - App store optimization requirements

  Guidelines:
  - Keep it simple but clear
  - Show key UI elements and content
  - Include navigation elements
  - Demonstrate information hierarchy
  - Show state (loading, empty, error) examples

success_criteria_additions:
  - Platform-specific requirements clearly defined
  - User journeys mapped end-to-end
  - ASCII mockups created and validated with user
  - App store and distribution requirements identified
  - Platform guidelines and constraints documented
  - Clear foundation for UI/UX design phase
