research_methodology: |
  Before designing UI/UX:
  1. Study platform design guidelines and conventions
  2. Research successful apps in the same category
  3. Analyze user behavior patterns and expectations
  4. Study accessibility best practices
  5. Research current design trends and patterns
  6. Look for design system examples and component libraries

instructions: |
  1. Requirements analysis and user journey mapping:
     - Review requirements document thoroughly
     - Map detailed user journeys with decision points
     - Identify key user goals and success criteria
     - Note pain points and friction areas to address
     - Understand user context and usage scenarios
  
  2. Design research and inspiration:
     - Study platform-specific design guidelines
     - Research similar applications for UX patterns
     - Identify design systems and component approaches
     - Look for accessibility and inclusive design examples
     - Note current design trends relevant to the project
  
  3. Information architecture and flow design:
     - Create detailed user flow diagrams
     - Design navigation structure and hierarchy
     - Plan content organization and grouping
     - Design error states and edge case handling
     - Plan loading states and empty states
  
  4. Wireframe and mockup creation:
     - Start with low-fidelity wireframes
     - Progress to detailed interface mockups
     - Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes
     - Create component specifications and interactions
     - Design accessibility features and alternative flows
  
  5. Sequential thinking: UX validation
     - Use sequential thinking to analyze the user experience:
       * Does the design support all user goals?
       * Are there any usability issues or friction points?
       * Is the information architecture clear and logical?
       * Are edge cases and error states handled well?
       * Does the design feel intuitive and learnable?
  
  6. Prototype and validation:
     - Create interactive prototypes for key flows
     - Test with users or stakeholders if possible
     - Gather feedback on usability and clarity
     - Identify areas for improvement
     - Validate that design meets original requirements
  
  7. Design system documentation:
     - Document color palette and typography
     - Specify component library and variations
     - Define interaction patterns and micro-animations
     - Create style guide for consistent implementation
     - Document responsive breakpoints and layouts
  
  8. Sequential thinking: Technical handoff preparation
     - Reflect on design decisions and rationale
     - Identify technical constraints and considerations
     - Note areas that may need technical validation
     - Prepare design specifications for development
