# Deep Reflection
Now its time to analyze what went wrong and what could be improved.
Read all artifacts that have been generated: `specs.md`, `contract-of-done.md`, `impl-plan.md`, `validation.md` and the code you had written
You should investigate why you failed, what went wrong, was it strategy? was it lack of information? was there some blocker or inefficiency in the process? and what you would do to improve?

For each identified point of failure, create a short reflection blog post, detailing the scenario, your initial strategy, your rationale behind that strategy, what went well, what went wrong, and what you would do next time and store them within the `~/memories/lessons` folder
Also summarize all your artifacts and add an entry into `~/memories/experience`, you should come up with a personalized slug for the task, note down the task, your full strategy and important notes including things to watch out for etc
