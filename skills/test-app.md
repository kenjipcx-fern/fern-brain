# Validate and Verify
Read the `contract-of-done.md` and go through each required flow, verify if the resultant app has been fulfilled by the app, create another file called `validation.md` and note down your findings for each feature (was it completed, does it work well? if not how much?
Ensure that the UI UX flow stays consistent with the one in the `contract-of-done.md` too, if any of these are not aligned, just accept that you have failed your job, detail your findings within `validation.md`
